## My process

### Built with

- Java
- Spring Boot

- JWT
- MySQL

### What I learned

This is the backend implementation of a job application tracker app. This project allowed me to test out my current knowledge and skills on Java/Spring Boot. From this project, I learned how to create classes and implement child classes/components through the 4 pillars of OOP: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation. I also learned to secure through Spring Security implementing with JWT for authentication.

### Continued development

In my continued development, I want to get more in-dept on these topics and create more advance applications.
